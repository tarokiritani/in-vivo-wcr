Weoclme to my repo for the analysis code of my experimental data. This is a collection of my jupyter notebooks for the analysis of electrophysiological, and anatomical data I acquired in the [Petersen Lab](http://lsens.epfl.ch/) at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland.
